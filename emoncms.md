The `emoncms` service sends a numerical payload to an [EmonCMS](http://emoncms.org/) instance. [EmonCMS](http://emoncms.org/) is a powerful open-source web-app for processing, logging and visualising energy, temperature and other environmental data.

The web-app can run locally or you can upload your readings to their server for viewing and monitoring via your own login (note this is likely to become a paid service in the medium term). See http://emoncms.org for details on installing and configuring your own instance.

By specifying the node id and input name in the mqttwarn target (see the ini example below) you can split different feeds into different nodes, and give each one a human readable name to identify them in EmonCMS.

```ini
[config:emoncms]
url     = <url of emoncms server e.g. http://localhost/emoncms or http://emoncms.org/emoncms>
apikey  = <apikey generated by the emoncms server>
timeout = 5
targets = {
    'usage'  : [ 1, 'usage' ],  # [ <nodeid>, <name> ]
    'solar'  : [ 1, 'solar' ]
    }
```
